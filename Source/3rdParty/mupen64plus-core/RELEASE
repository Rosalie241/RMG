 - Removed all GUI code from plugins, making them simpler and more portable
 - User interface development is not tied to Core emulator releases
 - All messages from core/plugins can be filtered and shown in GUI instead of only on console
 - Video Extension allows Front-end to override some video functions, ie to support embedded render window
 - Startup in Fullscreen mode, instead of always starting in windowed mode and switching to FS after few seconds
 - video resolution can be given via command-line parameter
 - all configuration options for core and plugins are in a single config file, can be configured with a single GUI
 - dummy plugins are automatically used if plugin loading fails for any reason
 - core and plugins all use the same conventions for where to put data/config files
Mupen64Plus core:
 - New feature: cheat code support
 - New feature: Keyboard shortcuts for Core commands are now user-configurable
 - New feature: can load/save PJ64 state files
 - Major code cleanup, refactored build system to separate source and object files
 - Removed many dependencies to simplify porting to other platforms

If rumble is not available on a controller, don't allow user to switch between rumble and mempack.  3. If rumble is selected in config file but not available on a controller, select mempack instead.

what's new in 0.5:
  - Core
    + detection of invalid code cache for ambiguous region now use
      adler32 (faster than previous algorithm)
    + fixed a bug in ini file compression
    + added support for framebuffer effects functions : these functions
      are there to help the plugins that support framebuffer extension
      to zilmar's spec. These functions are based on rice's idea. I've
      worked closely with Gonetz to implement these and the only plugin
      that support this feature is Glide64 0.8 (when option is enabled).
      Many hard to emulate framebuffer effects are supported by this
      feature. Mariokart's monitor in first race running fullspeed and
      puzzle effect in banjo's intro are two examples that i can think
      about but there are many more.
    + detection of VI interrupt rate works on weird country codes
    + better detection of self modifying code in dma
    + warnings fixed on new gcc versions
    + rsp's dmem and imem are now contiguous in PC's memory (some windows
      plugins were requiring this)
    + slightly improved audio timing
    + better detection of self modifying code when accessing memory 
      through TLB
    + fixed a bug in RSP memory write
    + reading from ai_current_delay register should work even when
      Count register is looping
    + in interpreter code : fixed a bug in jump opcodes (detection
      of exceptions in delay slot in some rare conditions)
    + the event scheduler has better support for Count register loops
    + better AI interrupt handling (for musyx games for example)
    + jump opcodes changed in pure interpreter core so that they are
      timed exactly like on the other cores (easier to debug this way)
    + fixed a bug when accessing memory through invalid TLB in LDL, LDR,
      LWL, LWR, SWL, SDL, SDR, SWR opcodes
    + added LL, SC opcodes
    + two consecutive jump opcodes doesn't crash in the dynarec (result
      is undefined according to the r4300 manual but some games are doing
      it).
    + basic implementation of fpu opcodes in dynarec
    + division by 0 in FPU opcodes is returning NaN
    + all jump opcodes implemented in the dynarec
    + faster inside function loop with dynarec (register cache)
    + various bug fixes in dynarec opcodes
    + memory access improvements in dynarec
  - Linux version
    + GUI and all plugins have been switched to GKT2 (all old plugins
      should be recompiled for GTK2)
    + detection of GTK 1.2 or GTK 2 in the configure script : if both
      are detected, the user can choose which one to use
    + configure script rewritten so that it's compatible with standard
      unix shells instead of bash
    + much improved multi-user install support : if multi-user is choosen
      in configure script, mupen64 should be compiled ("make") and installed
      ("make install"). Then, when a user launch mupen64, it will create
      automatically a .mupen64 folder in his home and put all required files
      there.
    + language saved and restored correctly when quitting mupen64
    + the console version (mupen64_nogui) has command line support and can
      read settings from the gui version config file thanks to jogibear's patch
    + autoincrement save slot option when quick saving (thanks to jdratlif's
      patch)
    + speed limiter in the core
    + support for plugin configuration changes when a rom is running
  - Windows version
    + autoincrement save slot option when quick saving (thanks to jdratlif's
      patch)
    + stabilty improvements on the GUI (when closing a rom for example)
    + added support for readScreen function to support avi recording feature
      on plugins that don't use opengl or directx (ie: glide64...)
  - Sound plugin
    + thread synchronisation improvements

what's new in 0.4:
  - A totally new core based on a dynamic recompiler with register caching, 
    it doesn't compile the fpu yet but it's already much faster compared 
    to older versions of mupen64 :)
  - Self mod code detection has been improved and emulation is faster now
  - A lot of little fixes that should improve compaibitlity quite a bit
  - A new video recording feature (record in own mupen64 movie format that
    can be converted later into a standard avi file)
  - The windows GUI has been redesigned by linker
  - A lot of other things i forgot... sorry :P

what's new in 0.3:
  - All versions
    + General speed up, 10-20 in most games
      Save states long loading time fixed, now it should load in less than
      a second
    + sound sync is far more accurate now (thanks to Azimer)
      it makes some additionnal games booting
    + 64dd detection to fix F-zero
    + a little idle loops bug has been fixed
  - Windows port
    + Configuration and initialisation of plugins now can be done prior
      running a rom. It fixes numerous configuration issues with plugins as
      well
    + Recent roms menu with option to clear and freeze
    + Command line arguments support with option to run in GUIless mode,
      compatible with 1964 options, read more about it in pdf
    + Choosing and saving of plugins used per game, access it from Rom
      Properties
    + Reset rom menu added
    + Speed Modifier to allow game to run at any speed between 1-200% of
      original
      Use + and - to increase, decrease it, while in the game. And . to
      return to 100%.
    + Start game in fullscreen option
    + Pause emulation when idle fixes
    + Global plugin settings (should be unchecked if you want to use plugins
      per game option from rom properties)
    + Switch on/off ToolBar (ALT+T) and Status Bar (ALT+S), useful when
      plugin sets wrong resolution in windowed mode, and for those who hate
      toolbars :)
    + Selection of columns to show in rom browser
    + English language template updated
    + Support for debugview by linker
      Put dll in the main folder, if you want to see log output
    + Tonnes of little fixes...

    + mario kart sound fixed

what's new in 0.2:
  - Core
    + better sound plugin integration
    + optimizations in interrupt handling
    + a totally new interpreter core (half of a compiler => far much faster)
      it caches the opcodes when they're decoded
    + self modifying code detection code for the new interpreter and the
      compiler when it'll be implemented
    + RSP plugin integration
    + pif2 implemented for banjo tooie
  - RSP hle plugin
    + the first version of this plugin based on uhle sound code
    + 3 main audio ucode implemented (based on uhle)
    + mp3 ucode implemented (direct asm to c translation)
    + jpeg ucode (direct asm to c translation)
    + boot code for btooie and dk
    + on windows: ability to use the hle part of a sound plugin while using another
      to output the sound (example: using hle from Azimer's plugin and
      ouputing with Jabo's plugin)
      This option doesn't work with azimer's audio plugin 0.3 version
