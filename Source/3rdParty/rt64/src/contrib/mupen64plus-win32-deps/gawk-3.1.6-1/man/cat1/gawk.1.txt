DESCRIPTION
       Gawk is the GNU Project's implementation of the AWK pro-
       gramming language.  It conforms to the definition of the
       language  in the POSIX 1003.1 Standard.  This version in
       turn is based on the description in The AWK  Programming
       Language,  by  Aho,  Kernighan, and Weinberger, with the
       additional features found in the System V Release 4 ver-
       sion  of  UNIX awk.  Gawk also provides more recent Bell
       Laboratories awk extensions, and a  number  of  GNU-spe-
       cific extensions.

       Pgawk is the profiling version of gawk.  It is identical
       in every way to gawk,  except  that  programs  run  more
       slowly,  and it automatically produces an execution pro-
       file in the file awkprof.out when done.  See the  --pro-
       file option, below.

       The command line consists of options to gawk itself, the
       AWK program text (if not supplied via the -f  or  --file
       options),  and  values  to be made available in the ARGC
       and ARGV pre-defined AWK variables.

OPTION FORMAT
       Gawk options may be either traditional POSIX one  letter
       options, or GNU-style long options.  POSIX options start
       with a single "-", while long options start  with  "--".
       Long options are provided for both GNU-specific features
       and for POSIX-mandated features.

       Following the POSIX standard, gawk-specific options  are
       supplied  via  arguments  to the -W option.  Multiple -W
       options may be supplied Each -W option has a correspond-
       ing  long  option, as detailed below.  Arguments to long
       options are either joined with the option by an =  sign,
       with  no  intervening spaces, or they may be provided in
       the next command line argument.   Long  options  may  be
       abbreviated, as long as the abbreviation remains unique.

OPTIONS
       Gawk accepts the following options, listed by frequency.

       -F fs
       --field-separator fs
              Use  fs  for the input field separator (the value
              of the FS predefined variable).

       -v var=val
       --assign var=val
              Assign the value val to the variable var,  before
              execution  of  the program begins.  Such variable
              values are available to the BEGIN block of an AWK
              program.

       -f program-file
       --file program-file
              Read  the  AWK  program source from the file pro-
              gram-file, instead of from the first command line
              argument.  Multiple -f (or --file) options may be
              used.

       -mf NNN
       -mr NNN
              Set various memory limits to the value NNN.   The
              f flag sets the maximum number of fields, and the
              r flag sets the maximum record size.   These  two
              flags  and the -m option are from an earlier ver-
              sion of the Bell Laboratories research version of
              UNIX  awk.   They are ignored by gawk, since gawk
              has no pre-defined limits.

       -W compat
       -W traditional
       --compat
       --traditional
              Run  in  compatibility  mode.   In  compatibility
              mode,  gawk behaves identically to UNIX awk; none
              of the GNU-specific  extensions  are  recognized.
              The  use  of  --traditional is preferred over the
              other forms of this option.  See GNU  EXTENSIONS,
              below, for more information.

       -W copyleft
       -W copyright
       --copyleft
       --copyright
              Print  the  short  version  of  the GNU copyright
              information message on the  standard  output  and
              exit successfully.

       -W dump-variables[=file]
       --dump-variables[=file]
              Print  a  sorted  list of global variables, their
              types and final values to file.  If  no  file  is
              provided,  gawk  uses a file named awkvars.out in
              the current directory.
              Having a list of all the global  variables  is  a
              good way to look for typographical errors in your
              programs.  You would also use this option if  you
              have a large program with a lot of functions, and
              you want to be sure  that  your  functions  don't
              inadvertently use global variables that you meant
              to be local.  (This is a particularly  easy  mis-
              take  to  make with simple variable names like i,
              j, and so on.)

       -W exec file
       --exec file
              Similar to -f, however, this  is  option  is  the
              last  one processed.  This should be used with #!
              scripts, particularly for  CGI  applications,  to
              avoid  passing  in  options or source code (!) on
              the command line from a URL.   This  option  dis-
              ables command-line variable assignments.

       -W gen-po
       --gen-po
              Scan  and  parse  the AWK program, and generate a
              GNU .po  format  file  on  standard  output  with
              entries  for  all localizable strings in the pro-
              gram.  The program itself is not  executed.   See
              the GNU gettext distribution for more information
              on .po files.

       -W help
       -W usage
       --help
       --usage
              Print a relatively short summary of the available
              options  on  the  standard  output.  (Per the GNU
              Coding Standards, these options cause an  immedi-
              ate, successful exit.)

       -W lint[=value]
       --lint[=value]
              Provide  warnings about constructs that are dubi-
              ous or non-portable to other AWK implementations.
              With an optional argument of fatal, lint warnings
              become fatal errors.  This may  be  drastic,  but
              its  use will certainly encourage the development
              of cleaner AWK programs.  With an optional  argu-
              ment  of invalid, only warnings about things that
              are actually invalid are  issued.  (This  is  not
              fully implemented yet.)

       -W lint-old
       --lint-old
              Provide  warnings  about  constructs that are not
              portable to the original version of Unix awk.

       -W non-decimal-data
       --non-decimal-data
              Recognize octal and hexadecimal values  in  input
              data.  Use this option with great caution!

       -W posix
       --posix
              This  turns  on compatibility mode, with the fol-
              lowing additional restrictions:

              · \x escape sequences are not recognized.

              · Only space and tab act as field separators when
                FS  is set to a single space, newline does not.

              · You cannot continue lines after ?  and :.

              · The synonym func for the  keyword  function  is
                not recognized.

              · The  operators  **  and  **=  cannot be used in
                place of ^ and ^=.

              · The fflush() function is not available.

       -W profile[=prof_file]
       --profile[=prof_file]
              Send profiling data to prof_file.  The default is
              awkprof.out.   When run with gawk, the profile is
              just a "pretty printed" version of  the  program.
              When  run with pgawk, the profile contains execu-
              tion counts of each statement in the  program  in
              the left margin and function call counts for each
              user-defined function.

       -W re-interval
       --re-interval
              Enable the use of interval expressions in regular
              expression  matching  (see  Regular  Expressions,
              below).  Interval expressions were not tradition-
              ally  available  in  the AWK language.  The POSIX
              standard added them, to make awk and  egrep  con-
              sistent  with  each other.  However, their use is
              likely to break old AWK programs,  so  gawk  only
              provides  them  if  they  are requested with this
              option, or when --posix is specified.

       -W source program-text
       --source program-text
              Use program-text  as  AWK  program  source  code.
              This   option  allows  the  easy  intermixing  of
              library functions (used via  the  -f  and  --file
              options)  with source code entered on the command
              line.  It is intended  primarily  for  medium  to
              large AWK programs used in shell scripts.

       -W use-lc-numeric
       --use-lc-numeric
              This  forces  gawk  to  use  the locale's decimal
              point  character   when   parsing   input   data.
              Although  the POSIX standard requires this behav-
              ior, and gawk does so when --posix is in  effect,
              the default is to follow traditional behavior and
              use a  period  as  the  decimal  point,  even  in
              locales where the period is not the decimal point
              character.  This  option  overrides  the  default
              behavior,  without  the full draconian strictness
              of the --posix option.

       -W version
       --version
              Print version  information  for  this  particular
              copy  of  gawk  on  the standard output.  This is
              useful mainly for knowing if the current copy  of
              gawk on your system is up to date with respect to
              whatever the Free  Software  Foundation  is  dis-
              tributing.   This  is  also useful when reporting
              bugs.   (Per  the  GNU  Coding  Standards,  these
              options cause an immediate, successful exit.)

       --     Signal  the  end  of  options.  This is useful to
              allow further arguments to the AWK program itself
              to  start  with a "-".  This provides consistency
              with the argument parsing convention used by most
              other POSIX programs.
       In  compatibility mode, any other options are flagged as
       invalid, but are otherwise ignored.   In  normal  opera-
       tion, as long as program text has been supplied, unknown
       options are passed on to the AWK  program  in  the  ARGV
       array  for  processing.  This is particularly useful for
       running AWK programs via the "#!" executable interpreter
       mechanism.
AWK PROGRAM EXECUTION
       An  AWK program consists of a sequence of pattern-action
       statements and optional function definitions.
              pattern   { action statements }
              function name(parameter list) { statements }
       Gawk first reads the program source  from  the  program-
       file(s)  if  specified,  from  arguments to --source, or
       from the first non-option argument on the command  line.
       The  -f  and --source options may be used multiple times
       on the command line.  Gawk reads the program text as  if
       all  the program-files and command line source texts had
       been concatenated together.  This is useful for building
       libraries  of  AWK  functions, without having to include
       them in each new AWK program that uses  them.   It  also
       provides  the ability to mix library functions with com-
       mand line programs.
       The environment variable AWKPATH specifies a search path
       to  use  when  finding  source  files  named with the -f
       option.  If this variable does not  exist,  the  default
       path is ".:/usr/local/share/awk".  (The actual directory
       may  vary,  depending  upon  how  gawk  was  built   and
       installed.)   If a file name given to the -f option con-
       tains a "/" character, no path search is performed.
       Gawk executes  AWK  programs  in  the  following  order.
       First,  all  variable  assignments  specified via the -v
       option are performed.  Next, gawk compiles  the  program
       into  an internal form.  Then, gawk executes the code in
       the BEGIN block(s) (if any), and then proceeds  to  read
       each  file  named  in  the  ARGV array.  If there are no
       files named on the command line, gawk reads the standard
       input.
       If  a  filename on the command line has the form var=val
       it is treated as a variable  assignment.   The  variable
       var will be assigned the value val.  (This happens after
       any BEGIN block(s) have been run.)  Command  line  vari-
       able assignment is most useful for dynamically assigning
       values to the variables AWK uses to control how input is
       broken  into  fields and records.  It is also useful for
       controlling state if multiple passes are needed  over  a
       single data file.
       If  the  value  of a particular element of ARGV is empty
       (""), gawk skips over it.
       For each record in the input, gawk tests to  see  if  it
       matches  any  pattern in the AWK program.  For each pat-
       tern that the record matches, the associated  action  is
       executed.   The  patterns  are  tested in the order they
       occur in the program.
       Finally, after all the input is exhausted, gawk executes
       the code in the END block(s) (if any).
VARIABLES, RECORDS AND FIELDS
       AWK variables are dynamic; they come into existence when
       they are first used.  Their values are either  floating-
       point  numbers  or  strings, or both, depending upon how
       they are used.  AWK also  has  one  dimensional  arrays;
       arrays  with multiple dimensions may be simulated.  Sev-
       eral pre-defined variables are set as  a  program  runs;
       these are described as needed and summarized below.
   Records
       Normally,  records  are separated by newline characters.
       You can control how records are separated  by  assigning
       values to the built-in variable RS.  If RS is any single
       character, that character separates records.  Otherwise,
       RS  is  a  regular  expression.   Text in the input that
       matches this regular expression  separates  the  record.
       However, in compatibility mode, only the first character
       of its string value is used for separating records.   If
       RS is set to the null string, then records are separated
       by blank lines.  When RS is set to the null string,  the
       newline  character  always acts as a field separator, in
       addition to whatever value FS may have.
   Fields
       As each input record is read,  gawk  splits  the  record
       into  fields,  using the value of the FS variable as the
       field separator.  If FS is a  single  character,  fields
       are  separated  by  that  character.   If FS is the null
       string, then each individual character becomes  a  sepa-
       rate field.  Otherwise, FS is expected to be a full reg-
       ular expression.  In the special case that FS is a  sin-
       gle space, fields are separated by runs of spaces and/or
       tabs and/or newlines.  (But see the section  POSIX  COM-
       PATIBILITY,  below).  NOTE: The value of IGNORECASE (see
       below) also affects how fields are split when  FS  is  a
       regular  expression,  and how records are separated when
       RS is a regular expression.
       If the FIELDWIDTHS variable is set to a space  separated
       list  of  numbers,  each field is expected to have fixed
       width, and gawk splits up the record using the specified
       widths.   The  value  of FS is ignored.  Assigning a new
       value to  FS  overrides  the  use  of  FIELDWIDTHS,  and
       restores the default behavior.
       Each  field in the input record may be referenced by its
       position, $1, $2, and so on.  $0 is  the  whole  record.
       Fields need not be referenced by constants:
              n = 5
              print $n
       prints the fifth field in the input record.
       The  variable NF is set to the total number of fields in
       the input record.
       References to non-existent  fields  (i.e.  fields  after
       $NF)  produce  the null-string.  However, assigning to a
       non-existent field (e.g., $(NF+2)  =  5)  increases  the
       value  of  NF,  creates  any intervening fields with the
       null string as their value, and causes the value  of  $0
       to be recomputed, with the fields being separated by the
       value of OFS.  References to  negative  numbered  fields
       cause  a fatal error.  Decrementing NF causes the values
       of fields past the new value to be lost, and  the  value
       of  $0 to be recomputed, with the fields being separated
       by the value of OFS.
       Assigning a value to an existing field causes the  whole
       record  to be rebuilt when $0 is referenced.  Similarly,
       assigning a value to $0 causes the record to be resplit,
       creating new values for the fields.
   Built-in Variables
       Gawk's built-in variables are:
       ARGC        The  number  of command line arguments (does
                   not include options to gawk, or the  program
                   source).
       ARGIND      The  index in ARGV of the current file being
                   processed.
       ARGV        Array of command line arguments.  The  array
                   is  indexed from 0 to ARGC - 1.  Dynamically
                   changing the contents of  ARGV  can  control
                   the files used for data.
       BINMODE     On   non-POSIX  systems,  specifies  use  of
                   "binary" mode for  all  file  I/O.   Numeric
                   values  of  1,  2,  or 3, specify that input
                   files, output files, or all  files,  respec-
                   tively,  should use binary I/O.  String val-
                   ues of "r", or "w" specify that input files,
                   or  output  files,  respectively, should use
                   binary I/O.  String values of "rw"  or  "wr"
                   specify  that  all  files  should use binary
                   I/O.  Any other string value is  treated  as
                   "rw", but generates a warning message.
       CONVFMT     The  conversion  format for numbers, "%.6g",
                   by default.
       ENVIRON     An array containing the values of  the  cur-
                   rent  environment.   The array is indexed by
                   the  environment  variables,  each   element
                   being the value of that variable (e.g., ENV-
                   IRON["HOME"] might be /home/arnold).  Chang-
                   ing  this array does not affect the environ-
                   ment seen by programs which gawk spawns  via
                   redirection or the system() function.
       ERRNO       If  a  system  error  occurs  either doing a
                   redirection for getline, during a  read  for
                   getline,  or  during  a  close(), then ERRNO
                   will contain a string describing the  error.
                   The  value is subject to translation in non-
                   English locales.
       FIELDWIDTHS A white-space separated list of fieldwidths.
                   When  set, gawk parses the input into fields
                   of fixed width, instead of using  the  value
                   of the FS variable as the field separator.
       FILENAME    The  name  of the current input file.  If no
                   files are specified on the command line, the
                   value of FILENAME is "-".  However, FILENAME
                   is undefined inside the BEGIN block  (unless
                   set by getline).
       FNR         The input record number in the current input
                   file.
       FS          The  input  field  separator,  a  space   by
                   default.  See Fields, above.
       IGNORECASE  Controls the case-sensitivity of all regular
                   expression  and   string   operations.    If
                   IGNORECASE has a non-zero value, then string
                   comparisons and pattern matching  in  rules,
                   field  splitting  with FS, record separating
                   with RS, regular expression matching with  ~
                   and  !~,  and the gensub(), gsub(), index(),
                   match(), split(), and sub()  built-in  func-
                   tions  all  ignore  case  when doing regular
                   expression  operations.   NOTE:  Array  sub-
                   scripting  is  not  affected.   However, the
                   asort() and asorti() functions are affected.
                   Thus,  if  IGNORECASE  is not equal to zero,
                   /aB/ matches all of the strings "ab",  "aB",
                   "Ab",  and "AB".  As with all AWK variables,
                   the initial value of IGNORECASE is zero,  so
                   all regular expression and string operations
                   are normally  case-sensitive.   Under  Unix,
                   the full ISO 8859-1 Latin-1 character set is
                   used when ignoring case.  As of gawk  3.1.4,
                   the  case  equivalencies  are  fully locale-
                   aware, based on the C  <ctype.h>  facilities
                   such as isalpha(), and toupper().
       LINT        Provides   dynamic  control  of  the  --lint
                   option from within  an  AWK  program.   When
                   true, gawk prints lint warnings. When false,
                   it does not.  When assigned the string value
                   "fatal",  lint warnings become fatal errors,
                   exactly like --lint=fatal.  Any  other  true
                   value just prints warnings.
       NF          The  number  of  fields in the current input
                   record.
       NR          The total number of input  records  seen  so
                   far.
       OFMT        The  output  format  for numbers, "%.6g", by
                   default.
       OFS         The  output  field  separator,  a  space  by
                   default.
       ORS         The  output  record  separator, by default a
                   newline.
       PROCINFO    The elements of this array provide access to
                   information  about  the running AWK program.
                   On some systems, there may  be  elements  in
                   the  array,  "group1"  through  "groupn" for
                   some n, which is the number of supplementary
                   groups  that  the  process  has.  Use the in
                   operator to test for  these  elements.   The
                   following  elements  are  guaranteed  to  be
                   available:
                   PROCINFO["egid"]   the value  of  the  gete-
                                      gid(2) system call.
                   PROCINFO["euid"]   the    value    of    the
                                      geteuid(2) system call.
                   PROCINFO["FS"]     "FS" if  field  splitting
                                      with  FS is in effect, or
                                      "FIELDWIDTHS"  if   field
                                      splitting   with   FIELD-
                                      WIDTHS is in effect.
                   PROCINFO["gid"]    the  value  of  the  get-
                                      gid(2) system call.
                   PROCINFO["pgrpid"] the  process  group ID of
                                      the current process.
                   PROCINFO["pid"]    the  process  ID  of  the
                                      current process.
                   PROCINFO["ppid"]   the  parent process ID of
                                      the current process.
                   PROCINFO["uid"]    the    value    of    the
                                      getuid(2) system call.
                   PROCINFO["version"]
                                      The   version   of  gawk.
                                      This  is  available  from
                                      version  3.1.4 and later.
       RS          The input record  separator,  by  default  a
                   newline.
       RT          The  record terminator.  Gawk sets RT to the
                   input text that  matched  the  character  or
                   regular expression specified by RS.
       RSTART      The  index of the first character matched by
                   match(); 0 if no match.  (This implies  that
                   character indices start at one.)
       RLENGTH     The length of the string matched by match();
                   -1 if no match.
       SUBSEP      The character used to separate multiple sub-
                   scripts   in   array  elements,  by  default
                   "\034".
       TEXTDOMAIN  The text domain of the AWK program; used  to
                   find the localized translations for the pro-
                   gram's strings.
   Arrays
       Arrays are subscripted with an expression between square
       brackets  ([ and ]).  If the expression is an expression
       list (expr, expr ...)  then the  array  subscript  is  a
       string  consisting  of the concatenation of the (string)
       value of each expression, separated by the value of  the
       SUBSEP variable.  This facility is used to simulate mul-
       tiply dimensioned arrays.  For example:
              i = "A"; j = "B"; k = "C"
              x[i, j, k] = "hello, world\n"
       assigns the string "hello, world\n" to  the  element  of
       the   array   x   which   is   indexed   by  the  string
       "A\034B\034C".  All arrays in AWK are associative,  i.e.
       indexed by string values.
       The  special operator in may be used to test if an array
       has an index consisting of a particular value.
              if (val in array)
                   print array[val]
       If the array has multiple  subscripts,  use  (i,  j)  in
       array.
       The in construct may also be used in a for loop to iter-
       ate over all the elements of an array.
       An element may be deleted from an array using the delete
       statement.   The  delete  statement  may also be used to
       delete the entire contents of an array, just by specify-
       ing the array name without a subscript.
   Variable Typing And Conversion
       Variables and fields may be (floating point) numbers, or
       strings, or both.  How the value of a variable is inter-
       preted  depends  upon its context.  If used in a numeric
       expression, it will be treated as a number; if used as a
       string it will be treated as a string.
       To  force a variable to be treated as a number, add 0 to
       it; to force it to be treated as a  string,  concatenate
       it with the null string.
       When a string must be converted to a number, the conver-
       sion is accomplished using strtod(3).  A number is  con-
       verted  to  a  string by using the value of CONVFMT as a
       format string for sprintf(3), with the numeric value  of
       the  variable as the argument.  However, even though all
       numbers in AWK are floating-point, integral  values  are
       always converted as integers.  Thus, given
              CONVFMT = "%2.2f"
              a = 12
              b = a ""
       the  variable  b  has  a  string  value  of "12" and not
       "12.00".
       When operating in POSIX mode (such as with  the  --posix
       command  line  option),  beware that locale settings may
       interfere with the way decimal numbers are treated:  the
       decimal separator of the numbers you are feeding to gawk
       must conform to what your locale would expect, be  it  a
       comma (,) or a period (.).
       Gawk  performs  comparisons as follows: If two variables
       are numeric, they  are  compared  numerically.   If  one
       value  is  numeric and the other has a string value that
       is a "numeric string," then comparisons  are  also  done
       numerically.   Otherwise, the numeric value is converted
       to a string and a string comparison is  performed.   Two
       strings are compared, of course, as strings.
       Note  that  string  constants,  such  as  "57",  are not
       numeric strings, they are string constants.  The idea of
       "numeric  string" only applies to fields, getline input,
       FILENAME, ARGV elements, ENVIRON elements and  the  ele-
       ments  of  an  array created by split() that are numeric
       strings.  The basic idea is that user  input,  and  only
       user  input,  that looks numeric, should be treated that
       way.
       Uninitialized variables have the numeric value 0 and the
       string value "" (the null, or empty, string).
   Octal and Hexadecimal Constants
       Starting  with version 3.1 of gawk , you may use C-style
       octal and hexadecimal  constants  in  your  AWK  program
       source  code.  For example, the octal value 011 is equal
       to decimal 9, and the hexadecimal value 0x11 is equal to
       decimal 17.
   String Constants
       String  constants  in  AWK  are  sequences of characters
       enclosed between double  quotes  (").   Within  strings,
       certain escape sequences are recognized, as in C.  These
       are:
       \\   A literal backslash.
       \a   The "alert" character; usually the ASCII BEL  char-
            acter.
       \b   backspace.
       \f   form-feed.
       \n   newline.
       \r   carriage return.
       \t   horizontal tab.
       \v   vertical tab.
       \xhex digits
            The character represented by the string of hexadec-
            imal digits following the \x.  As in  ANSI  C,  all
            following hexadecimal digits are considered part of
            the escape sequence.  (This feature should tell  us
            something  about  language  design  by  committee.)
            E.g., "\x1B" is the ASCII ESC (escape) character.
       \ddd The character represented by the 1-, 2-, or 3-digit
            sequence  of  octal  digits.   E.g.,  "\033" is the
            ASCII ESC (escape) character.
       \c   The literal character c.
       The escape sequences may also be  used  inside  constant
       regular   expressions   (e.g.,  /[ \t\f\n\r\v]/  matches
       whitespace characters).
       In compatibility mode,  the  characters  represented  by
       octal  and hexadecimal escape sequences are treated lit-
       erally when used in regular expression constants.  Thus,
       /a\52b/ is equivalent to /a\*b/.
PATTERNS AND ACTIONS
       AWK  is  a  line-oriented  language.   The pattern comes
       first, and  then  the  action.   Action  statements  are
       enclosed in { and }.  Either the pattern may be missing,
       or the action may be missing, but, of course, not  both.
       If  the  pattern  is missing, the action is executed for
       every single record  of  input.   A  missing  action  is
       equivalent to
              { print }
       which prints the entire record.
       Comments  begin  with  the  "#"  character, and continue
       until the end of the line.  Blank lines may be  used  to
       separate  statements.  Normally, a statement ends with a
       newline, however, this is not the case for lines  ending
       in  a  ",",  {,  ?, :, &&, or ||.  Lines ending in do or
       else also have their statements automatically  continued
       on  the  following  line.  In other cases, a line can be
       continued by ending it with a "\",  in  which  case  the
       newline will be ignored.
       Multiple statements may be put on one line by separating
       them with a ";".  This applies to  both  the  statements
       within  the  action  part  of a pattern-action pair (the
       usual case), and to the pattern-action statements  them-
       selves.
   Patterns
       AWK patterns may be one of the following:
              BEGIN
              END
              /regular expression/
              relational expression
              pattern && pattern
              pattern || pattern
              pattern ? pattern : pattern
              (pattern)
              ! pattern
              pattern1, pattern2
       BEGIN  and  END  are two special kinds of patterns which
       are not tested against the input.  The action  parts  of
       all  BEGIN  patterns are merged as if all the statements
       had been written in a single BEGIN block.  They are exe-
       cuted  before  any of the input is read.  Similarly, all
       the END blocks are merged, and  executed  when  all  the
       input  is  exhausted  (or when an exit statement is exe-
       cuted).  BEGIN and END patterns cannot be combined  with
       other  patterns  in  pattern expressions.  BEGIN and END
       patterns cannot have missing action parts.
       For /regular expression/ patterns, the associated state-
       ment  is executed for each input record that matches the
       regular expression.  Regular expressions are the same as
       those in egrep(1), and are summarized below.
       A  relational  expression  may  use any of the operators
       defined below in the section on actions.   These  gener-
       ally  test  whether certain fields match certain regular
       expressions.
       The &&, ||, and !  operators are  logical  AND,  logical
       OR,  and  logical  NOT,  respectively, as in C.  They do
       short-circuit evaluation, also as in C, and are used for
       combining  more  primitive  pattern  expressions.  As in
       most languages, parentheses may be used  to  change  the
       order of evaluation.
       The  ?: operator is like the same operator in C.  If the
       first pattern is true then the pattern used for  testing
       is  the second pattern, otherwise it is the third.  Only
       one of the second and third patterns is evaluated.
       The pattern1, pattern2 form of an expression is called a
       range  pattern.   It  matches all input records starting
       with a record  that  matches  pattern1,  and  continuing
       until  a  record  that  matches pattern2, inclusive.  It
       does not combine with any other sort of pattern  expres-
       sion.
   Regular Expressions
       Regular  expressions  are  the  extended  kind  found in
       egrep.  They are composed of characters as follows:
       c          matches the non-metacharacter c.
       \c         matches the literal character c.
       .          matches any character including newline.
       ^          matches the beginning of a string.
       $          matches the end of a string.
       [abc...]   character list, matches any of the characters
                  abc....
       [^abc...]  negated character list, matches any character
                  except abc....
       r1|r2      alternation: matches either r1 or r2.
       r1r2       concatenation: matches r1, and then r2.
       r+         matches one or more r's.
       r*         matches zero or more r's.
       r?         matches zero or one r's.
       (r)        grouping: matches r.
       r{n}
       r{n,}
       r{n,m}     One or two numbers inside  braces  denote  an
                  interval  expression.  If there is one number
                  in the braces, the preceding regular  expres-
                  sion r is repeated n times.  If there are two
                  numbers separated by a comma, r is repeated n
                  to  m times.  If there is one number followed
                  by a comma, then r is  repeated  at  least  n
                  times.
                  Interval  expressions  are  only available if
                  either --posix or --re-interval is  specified
                  on the command line.

       \y         matches the empty string at either the begin-
                  ning or the end of a word.

       \B         matches the empty string within a word.

       \<         matches the empty string at the beginning  of
                  a word.

       \>         matches  the  empty  string  at  the end of a
                  word.

       \w         matches any word-constituent character  (let-
                  ter, digit, or underscore).

       \W         matches  any  character that is not word-con-
                  stituent.

       \`         matches the empty string at the beginning  of
                  a buffer (string).

       \'         matches  the  empty  string  at  the end of a
                  buffer.

       The escape sequences that are valid in string  constants
       (see below) are also valid in regular expressions.

       Character  classes are a feature introduced in the POSIX
       standard.  A character class is a special  notation  for
       describing  lists  of  characters  that  have a specific
       attribute, but where the  actual  characters  themselves
       can  vary  from country to country and/or from character
       set to character set.  For example, the notion  of  what
       is  an  alphabetic  character  differs in the USA and in
       France.

       A character class is only valid in a regular  expression
       inside  the  brackets  of  a  character list.  Character
       classes consist of [:, a keyword denoting the class, and
       :].  The character classes defined by the POSIX standard
       are:

       [:alnum:]  Alphanumeric characters.

       [:alpha:]  Alphabetic characters.

       [:blank:]  Space or tab characters.

       [:cntrl:]  Control characters.

       [:digit:]  Numeric characters.

       [:graph:]  Characters that are both printable and  visi-
                  ble.  (A space is printable, but not visible,
                  while an a is both.)

       [:lower:]  Lower-case alphabetic characters.

       [:print:]  Printable characters (characters that are not
                  control characters.)

       [:punct:]  Punctuation  characters  (characters that are
                  not letter, digits,  control  characters,  or
                  space characters).

       [:space:]  Space  characters  (such  as  space, tab, and
                  formfeed, to name a few).

       [:upper:]  Upper-case alphabetic characters.

       [:xdigit:] Characters that are hexadecimal digits.

       For  example,  before  the  POSIX  standard,  to   match
       alphanumeric  characters,  you  would  have had to write
       /[A-Za-z0-9]/.  If your character set had  other  alpha-
       betic  characters  in it, this would not match them, and
       if your character set collated differently  from  ASCII,
       this might not even match the ASCII alphanumeric charac-
       ters.  With the POSIX character classes, you  can  write
       /[[:alnum:]]/,  and  this  matches  the  alphabetic  and
       numeric characters in your character set, no matter what
       it is.

       Two additional special sequences can appear in character
       lists.  These apply to non-ASCII character  sets,  which
       can have single symbols (called collating elements) that
       are represented with more than one character, as well as
       several characters that are equivalent for collating, or
       sorting, purposes.  (E.g., in French, a plain "e" and  a
       grave-accented "`" are equivalent.)

       Collating Symbols
              A collating symbol is a multi-character collating
              element enclosed in [.  and .].  For example,  if
              ch  is  a  collating element, then [[.ch.]]  is a
              regular expression that  matches  this  collating
              element,  while [ch] is a regular expression that
              matches either c or h.

       Equivalence Classes
              An equivalence class is  a  locale-specific  name
              for  a  list  of  characters that are equivalent.
              The name is enclosed in [= and =].  For  example,
              the name e might be used to represent all of "e,"
              "´," and "`."  In this case, [[=e=]] is a regular
              expression that matches any of e, ´, or `.

       These features are very valuable in non-English speaking
       locales.  The library functions that gawk uses for regu-
       lar  expression  matching currently only recognize POSIX
       character classes; they do not recognize collating  sym-
       bols or equivalence classes.

       The  \y,  \B,  \<,  \>, \w, \W, \`, and \' operators are
       specific to gawk; they are extensions based  on  facili-
       ties in the GNU regular expression libraries.

       The various command line options control how gawk inter-
       prets characters in regular expressions.

       No options
              In the default case, gawk provide all the facili-
              ties  of  POSIX  regular  expressions and the GNU
              regular  expression  operators  described  above.
              However,  interval expressions are not supported.

       --posix
              Only POSIX regular expressions are supported, the
              GNU operators are not special.  (E.g., \w matches
              a literal w).  Interval expressions are  allowed.

       --traditional
              Traditional  Unix  awk  regular  expressions  are
              matched.  The  GNU  operators  are  not  special,
              interval  expressions are not available, and nei-
              ther are the POSIX character classes ([[:alnum:]]
              and  so  on).   Characters described by octal and
              hexadecimal escape sequences are  treated  liter-
              ally,  even  if they represent regular expression
              metacharacters.

       --re-interval
              Allow interval  expressions  in  regular  expres-
              sions, even if --traditional has been provided.

   Actions
       Action  statements  are  enclosed  in  braces,  { and }.
       Action statements consist of the usual assignment,  con-
       ditional,  and  looping  statements  found  in most lan-
       guages.   The   operators,   control   statements,   and
       input/output  statements  available  are patterned after
       those in C.

   Operators
       The operators in AWK, in order of decreasing precedence,
       are


       (...)       Grouping

       $           Field reference.

       ++ --       Increment  and  decrement,  both  prefix and
                   postfix.

       ^           Exponentiation (** may also be used, and **=
                   for the assignment operator).

       + - !       Unary  plus,  unary minus, and logical nega-
                   tion.

       * / %       Multiplication, division, and modulus.

       + -         Addition and subtraction.

       space       String concatenation.

       | |&        Piped I/O for getline, print, and printf.

       < >
       <= >=
       != ==       The regular relational operators.

       ~ !~        Regular  expression  match,  negated  match.
                   NOTE:  Do not use a constant regular expres-
                   sion (/foo/) on the left-hand side of a ~ or
                   !~.   Only  use  one on the right-hand side.
                   The expression /foo/  ~  exp  has  the  same
                   meaning  as  (($0  ~ /foo/) ~ exp).  This is
                   usually not what was intended.

       in          Array membership.

       &&          Logical AND.

       ||          Logical OR.

       ?:          The C conditional expression.  This has  the
                   form  expr1  ?  expr2  : expr3.  If expr1 is
                   true, the value of the expression is  expr2,
                   otherwise  it  is  expr3.  Only one of expr2
                   and expr3 is evaluated.

       = += -=
       *= /= %= ^= Assignment.  Both absolute assignment (var =
                   value)  and  operator-assignment  (the other
                   forms) are supported.

   Control Statements
       The control statements are as follows:

              if (condition) statement [ else statement ]
              while (condition) statement
              do statement while (condition)
              for (expr1; expr2; expr3) statement
              for (var in array) statement
              break
              continue
              delete array[index]
              delete array
              exit [ expression ]
              { statements }

   I/O Statements
       The input/output statements are as follows:


       close(file [, how])   Close file,  pipe  or  co-process.
                             The  optional  how  should only be
                             used when closing  one  end  of  a
                             two-way  pipe to a co-process.  It
                             must be  a  string  value,  either
                             "to" or "from".

       getline               Set $0 from next input record; set
                             NF, NR, FNR.

       getline <file         Set $0 from next record  of  file;
                             set NF.

       getline var           Set  var  from  next input record;
                             set NR, FNR.

       getline var <file     Set var from next record of  file.

       command | getline [var]
                             Run   command  piping  the  output
                             either into $0 or var, as above.

       command |& getline [var]
                             Run command as a co-process piping
                             the  output either into $0 or var,
                             as above.  Co-processes are a gawk
                             extension.  (command can also be a
                             socket.  See the  subsection  Spe-
                             cial File Names, below.)

       next                  Stop  processing the current input
                             record.  The next input record  is
                             read  and  processing  starts over
                             with the first pattern in the  AWK
                             program.   If the end of the input
                             data is reached, the END block(s),
                             if any, are executed.

       nextfile              Stop  processing the current input
                             file.  The next input record  read
                             comes  from  the  next input file.
                             FILENAME and ARGIND  are  updated,
                             FNR  is reset to 1, and processing
                             starts over with the first pattern
                             in  the AWK program. If the end of
                             the input data is reached, the END
                             block(s), if any, are executed.

       print                 Prints  the  current  record.  The
                             output record is  terminated  with
                             the value of the ORS variable.

       print expr-list       Prints  expressions.  Each expres-
                             sion is separated by the value  of
                             the   OFS  variable.   The  output
                             record  is  terminated  with   the
                             value of the ORS variable.

       print expr-list >file Prints  expressions on file.  Each
                             expression  is  separated  by  the
                             value  of  the  OFS variable.  The
                             output record is  terminated  with
                             the value of the ORS variable.

       printf fmt, expr-list Format and print.

       printf fmt, expr-list >file
                             Format and print on file.

       system(cmd-line)      Execute  the command cmd-line, and
                             return the exit status.  (This may
                             not be available on non-POSIX sys-
                             tems.)

       fflush([file])        Flush any buffers associated  with
                             the open output file or pipe file.
                             If file is missing, then  standard
                             output is flushed.  If file is the
                             null string, then all open  output
                             files and pipes have their buffers
                             flushed.

       Additional output redirections are allowed for print and
       printf.

       print ... >> file
              Appends output to the file.

       print ... | command
              Writes on a pipe.

       print ... |& command
              Sends  data to a co-process or socket.  (See also
              the subsection Special File Names, below.)

       The getline command returns 0 on end of file and  -1  on
       an  error.   Upon  an  error,  ERRNO  contains  a string
       describing the problem.

       NOTE: If using a pipe, co-process, or socket to getline,
       or  from  print  or  printf  within a loop, you must use
       close() to  create  new  instances  of  the  command  or
       socket.   AWK  does not automatically close pipes, sock-
       ets, or co-processes when they return EOF.

   The printf Statement
       The AWK versions of the printf statement  and  sprintf()
       function  (see  below)  accept  the following conversion
       specification formats:

       %c      An ASCII character.  If the argument used for %c
               is  numeric,  it  is  treated as a character and
               printed.  Otherwise, the argument is assumed  to
               be  a  string,  and  the only first character of
               that string is printed.

       %d, %i  A decimal number (the integer part).

       %e, %E  A   floating   point   number   of   the    form
               [-]d.dddddde[+-]dd.    The   %E  format  uses  E
               instead of e.

       %f, %F  A   floating   point   number   of   the    form
               [-]ddd.dddddd.   If  the system library supports
               it, %F is available as well. This  is  like  %f,
               but uses capital letters for special "not a num-
               ber" and "infinity" values. If %F is not  avail-
               able, gawk uses %f.

       %g, %G  Use  %e  or %f conversion, whichever is shorter,
               with nonsignificant zeros  suppressed.   The  %G
               format uses %E instead of %e.

       %o      An unsigned octal number (also an integer).

       %u      An  unsigned decimal number (again, an integer).

       %s      A character string.

       %x, %X  An unsigned  hexadecimal  number  (an  integer).
               The %X format uses ABCDEF instead of abcdef.

       %%      A  single % character; no argument is converted.

       NOTE: When using the integer format-control letters  for
       values  that  are outside the range of a C long integer,
       gawk switches to the %0f format specifier. If --lint  is
       provided  on  the  command  line  gawk warns about this.
       Other versions of awk may print  invalid  values  or  do
       something else entirely.

       Optional,  additional  parameters  may lie between the %
       and the control letter:

       count$ Use the count'th argument at this  point  in  the
              formatting.   This  is called a positional speci-
              fier and is intended primarily for use in  trans-
              lated  versions  of  format  strings,  not in the
              original text of an AWK program.  It  is  a  gawk
              extension.

       -      The  expression  should  be left-justified within
              its field.

       space  For numeric conversions, prefix  positive  values
              with  a  space,  and negative values with a minus
              sign.

       +      The plus sign, used  before  the  width  modifier
              (see  below),  says  to  always supply a sign for
              numeric conversions, even if the data to be  for-
              matted  is  positive.   The + overrides the space
              modifier.

       #      Use an "alternate form" for certain control  let-
              ters.   For  %o,  supply a leading zero.  For %x,
              and %X, supply a leading 0x or 0X for  a  nonzero
              result.  For %e, %E, %f and %F, the result always
              contains a decimal point.  For %g, and %G, trail-
              ing zeros are not removed from the result.

       0      A leading 0 (zero) acts as a flag, that indicates
              output should be padded with  zeroes  instead  of
              spaces.   This applies even to non-numeric output
              formats.  This flag only has an effect  when  the
              field  width  is  wider  than  the  value  to  be
              printed.

       width  The field should be padded to  this  width.   The
              field  is  normally padded with spaces.  If the 0
              flag has been used, it is padded with zeroes.

       .prec  A number that specifies the precision to use when
              printing.   For  the  %e, %E, %f and %F, formats,
              this specifies the  number  of  digits  you  want
              printed  to  the right of the decimal point.  For
              the %g, and %G formats, it specifies the  maximum
              number  of  significant  digits.  For the %d, %o,
              %i, %u, %x, and %X formats, it specifies the min-
              imum number of digits to print.  For %s, it spec-
              ifies the maximum number of characters  from  the
              string that should be printed.

       The  dynamic  width  and prec capabilities of the ANSI C
       printf() routines are supported.  A * in place of either
       the  width or prec specifications causes their values to
       be taken from the argument list to printf or  sprintf().
       To  use  a  positional specifier with a dynamic width or
       precision, supply the count$ after the * in  the  format
       string.  For example, "%3$*2$.*1$s".

   Special File Names
       When  doing  I/O redirection from either print or printf
       into a file, or via getline from a file, gawk recognizes
       certain  special  filenames internally.  These filenames
       allow access to open  file  descriptors  inherited  from
       gawk's  parent  process (usually the shell).  These file
       names may also be used on the command line to name  data
       files.  The filenames are:

       /dev/stdin  The standard input.

       /dev/stdout The standard output.

       /dev/stderr The standard error output.

       /dev/fd/n   The  file  associated  with  the  open  file
                   descriptor n.

       These are particularly useful for error  messages.   For
       example:

              print "You blew it!" > "/dev/stderr"

       whereas you would otherwise have to use

              print "You blew it!" | "cat 1>&2"

       The  following special filenames may be used with the |&
       co-process operator for creating TCP/IP network  connec-
       tions.

       /inet/tcp/lport/rhost/rport  File  for TCP/IP connection
                                    on  local  port  lport   to
                                    remote host rhost on remote
                                    port rport.  Use a port  of
                                    0 to have the system pick a
                                    port.

       /inet/udp/lport/rhost/rport  Similar,  but  use   UDP/IP
                                    instead of TCP/IP.

       /inet/raw/lport/rhost/rport  Reserved for future use.

       Other  special  filenames  provide access to information
       about the running gawk process.  These filenames are now
       obsolete.  Use the PROCINFO array to obtain the informa-
       tion they provide.  The filenames are:

       /dev/pid    Reading this file returns the process ID  of
                   the  current process, in decimal, terminated
                   with a newline.

       /dev/ppid   Reading this file returns the parent process
                   ID  of the current process, in decimal, ter-
                   minated with a newline.

       /dev/pgrpid Reading this file returns the process  group
                   ID  of the current process, in decimal, ter-
                   minated with a newline.

       /dev/user   Reading this file returns  a  single  record
                   terminated  with  a newline.  The fields are
                   separated with spaces.  $1 is the  value  of
                   the  getuid(2)  system call, $2 is the value
                   of the geteuid(2) system  call,  $3  is  the
                   value  of  the getgid(2) system call, and $4
                   is the value of the getegid(2) system  call.
                   If there are any additional fields, they are
                   the  group  IDs  returned  by  getgroups(2).
                   Multiple  groups may not be supported on all
                   systems.

   Numeric Functions
       AWK has the following built-in arithmetic functions:


       atan2(y, x)   Returns the arctangent of y/x in  radians.

       cos(expr)     Returns  the  cosine  of expr, which is in
                     radians.

       exp(expr)     The exponential function.

       int(expr)     Truncates to integer.

       log(expr)     The natural logarithm function.

       rand()        Returns a random number N, between  0  and
                     1, such that 0 <= N < 1.

       sin(expr)     Returns  the  sine  of  expr,  which is in
                     radians.

       sqrt(expr)    The square root function.

       srand([expr]) Uses expr as a new  seed  for  the  random
                     number generator.  If no expr is provided,
                     the time of day is used.  The return value
                     is the previous seed for the random number
                     generator.

   String Functions
       Gawk has the following built-in string functions:


       asort(s [, d])          Returns the number  of  elements
                               in the source array s.  The con-
                               tents  of  s  are  sorted  using
                               gawk's  normal rules for compar-
                               ing values, and the  indices  of
                               the   sorted  values  of  s  are
                               replaced with  sequential  inte-
                               gers  starting  with  1.  If the
                               optional destination array d  is
                               specified,   then   s  is  first
                               duplicated into d, and then d is
                               sorted,  leaving  the indices of
                               the source array s unchanged.

       asorti(s [, d])         Returns the number  of  elements
                               in  the  source  array  s.   The
                               behavior is the same as that  of
                               asort(),  except  that the array
                               indices are  used  for  sorting,
                               not   the  array  values.   When
                               done,  the  array   is   indexed
                               numerically,  and the values are
                               those of the  original  indices.
                               The  original  values  are lost;
                               thus provide a second  array  if
                               you  wish to preserve the origi-
                               nal.

       gensub(r, s, h [, t])   Search the target string  t  for
                               matches  of  the regular expres-
                               sion r.  If h is a string begin-
                               ning  with  g or G, then replace
                               all matches of r with s.  Other-
                               wise,  h  is a number indicating
                               which match of r to replace.  If
                               t  is  not  supplied, $0 is used
                               instead.  Within the replacement
                               text s, the sequence \n, where n
                               is a digit from 1 to 9,  may  be
                               used  to  indicate just the text
                               that matched the n'th  parenthe-
                               sized     subexpression.     The
                               sequence   \0   represents   the
                               entire matched text, as does the
                               character &.  Unlike  sub()  and
                               gsub(),  the  modified string is
                               returned as the  result  of  the
                               function,  and the original tar-
                               get string is not changed.

       gsub(r, s [, t])        For each substring matching  the
                               regular   expression  r  in  the
                               string t, substitute the  string
                               s, and return the number of sub-
                               stitutions.  If t  is  not  sup-
                               plied,  use  $0.   An  &  in the
                               replacement  text  is   replaced
                               with  the text that was actually
                               matched.  Use \& to get  a  lit-
                               eral  &.  (This must be typed as
                               "\\&"; see GAWK:  Effective  AWK
                               Programming for a fuller discus-
                               sion of the rules  for  &'s  and
                               backslashes  in  the replacement
                               text of sub(), gsub(), and  gen-
                               sub().)

       index(s, t)             Returns  the index of the string
                               t in the string s, or 0 if t  is
                               not present.  (This implies that
                               character indices start at one.)

       length([s])             Returns the length of the string
                               s, or the length of $0 if  s  is
                               not   supplied.   Starting  with
                               version 3.1.5, as a non-standard
                               extension,  with  an array argu-
                               ment, length() returns the  num-
                               ber of elements in the array.

       match(s, r [, a])       Returns  the position in s where
                               the regular expression r occurs,
                               or  0  if  r is not present, and
                               sets the values  of  RSTART  and
                               RLENGTH.  Note that the argument
                               order is the same as for  the  ~
                               operator:  str ~ re.  If array a
                               is provided, a  is  cleared  and
                               then  elements  1  through n are
                               filled with the  portions  of  s
                               that   match  the  corresponding
                               parenthesized  subexpression  in
                               r.   The  0'th element of a con-
                               tains the portion of  s  matched
                               by the entire regular expression
                               r.   Subscripts  a[n,  "start"],
                               and  a[n,  "length"] provide the
                               starting index in the string and
                               length   respectively,  of  each
                               matching substring.

       split(s, a [, r])       Splits the  string  s  into  the
                               array  a  on the regular expres-
                               sion r, and returns  the  number
                               of  fields.  If r is omitted, FS
                               is used instead.  The array a is
                               cleared     first.     Splitting
                               behaves  identically  to   field
                               splitting, described above.

       sprintf(fmt, expr-list) Prints  expr-list  according  to
                               fmt, and returns  the  resulting
                               string.

       strtonum(str)           Examines  str,  and  returns its
                               numeric value.   If  str  begins
                               with  a  leading  0,  strtonum()
                               assumes that  str  is  an  octal
                               number.   If  str  begins with a
                               leading  0x  or  0X,  strtonum()
                               assumes  that str is a hexadeci-
                               mal number.

       sub(r, s [, t])         Just like gsub(), but  only  the
                               first   matching   substring  is
                               replaced.

       substr(s, i [, n])      Returns the at most  n-character
                               substring  of  s  starting at i.
                               If n is omitted, the rest  of  s
                               is used.

       tolower(str)            Returns  a  copy  of  the string
                               str,  with  all  the  upper-case
                               characters  in str translated to
                               their  corresponding  lower-case
                               counterparts.     Non-alphabetic
                               characters are left unchanged.

       toupper(str)            Returns a  copy  of  the  string
                               str,  with  all  the  lower-case
                               characters in str translated  to
                               their  corresponding  upper-case
                               counterparts.     Non-alphabetic
                               characters are left unchanged.

       As  of  version  3.1.5,  gawk  is multibyte aware.  This
       means that index(), length(), substr() and  match()  all
       work in terms of characters, not bytes.

   Time Functions
       Since  one  of  the primary uses of AWK programs is pro-
       cessing log files that contain time  stamp  information,
       gawk provides the following functions for obtaining time
       stamps and formatting them.


       mktime(datespec)
                 Turns datespec into a time stamp of  the  same
                 form  as  returned by systime().  The datespec
                 is a string of the form YYYY MM DD HH  MM  SS[
                 DST].   The  contents of the string are six or
                 seven numbers  representing  respectively  the
                 full  year including century, the month from 1
                 to 12, the day of the month from 1 to 31,  the
                 hour  of the day from 0 to 23, the minute from
                 0 to 59, and the second from 0 to 60,  and  an
                 optional  daylight saving flag.  The values of
                 these numbers need not be  within  the  ranges
                 specified;  for example, an hour of -1 means 1
                 hour before midnight.  The origin-zero  Grego-
                 rian  calendar is assumed, with year 0 preced-
                 ing year 1 and year -1 preceding year 0.   The
                 time  is  assumed to be in the local timezone.
                 If the daylight saving flag is  positive,  the
                 time is assumed to be daylight saving time; if
                 zero, the time is assumed to be standard time;
                 and   if   negative  (the  default),  mktime()
                 attempts to determine whether daylight  saving
                 time  is in effect for the specified time.  If
                 datespec does not contain enough  elements  or
                 if   the  resulting  time  is  out  of  range,
                 mktime() returns -1.

       strftime([format [, timestamp[, utc-flag]]])
                 Formats timestamp according to the  specifica-
                 tion in format.  If utc-flag is present and is
                 non-zero or non-null, the result  is  in  UTC,
                 otherwise  the  result  is in local time.  The
                 timestamp  should  be  of  the  same  form  as
                 returned  by systime().  If timestamp is miss-
                 ing, the current time of day is used.  If for-
                 mat is missing, a default format equivalent to
                 the output of date(1) is used.  See the speci-
                 fication for the strftime() function in ANSI C
                 for the format conversions that are guaranteed
                 to be available.

       systime() Returns  the current time of day as the number
                 of  seconds  since   the   Epoch   (1970-01-01
                 00:00:00 UTC on POSIX systems).

   Bit Manipulations Functions
       Starting  with  version  3.1  of gawk, the following bit
       manipulation functions are available.  They work by con-
       verting   double-precision   floating  point  values  to
       uintmax_t integers, doing the operation, and  then  con-
       verting  the  result  back to floating point.  The func-
       tions are:

       and(v1, v2)         Return the bitwise AND of the values
                           provided by v1 and v2.

       compl(val)          Return  the  bitwise  complement  of
                           val.

       lshift(val, count)  Return the  value  of  val,  shifted
                           left by count bits.

       or(v1, v2)          Return  the bitwise OR of the values
                           provided by v1 and v2.

       rshift(val, count)  Return the  value  of  val,  shifted
                           right by count bits.

       xor(v1, v2)         Return the bitwise XOR of the values
                           provided by v1 and v2.


   Internationalization Functions
       Starting with version 3.1 of gawk, the  following  func-
       tions  may  be  used  from  within  your AWK program for
       translating strings at run-time.  For full details,  see
       GAWK: Effective AWK Programming.

       bindtextdomain(directory [, domain])
              Specifies  the directory where gawk looks for the
              .mo files, in case they will  not  or  cannot  be
              placed  in the ``standard'' locations (e.g., dur-
              ing testing).  It  returns  the  directory  where
              domain is ``bound.''
              The  default  domain  is the value of TEXTDOMAIN.
              If directory is the null string (""), then  bind-
              textdomain()  returns the current binding for the
              given domain.

       dcgettext(string [, domain [, category]])
              Returns the translation of string in text  domain
              domain for locale category category.  The default
              value for domain is the current value of  TEXTDO-
              MAIN.  The default value for category is "LC_MES-
              SAGES".
              If you supply a value for category, it must be  a
              string  equal  to  one  of the known locale cate-
              gories described in GAWK: Effective AWK  Program-
              ming.   You  must also supply a text domain.  Use
              TEXTDOMAIN if you want to use the current domain.

       dcngettext(string1 , string2 , number [, domain [, cate-
       gory]])
              Returns  the  plural  form used for number of the
              translation of string1 and string2 in text domain
              domain for locale category category.  The default
              value for domain is the current value of  TEXTDO-
              MAIN.  The default value for category is "LC_MES-
              SAGES".
              If you supply a value for category, it must be  a
              string  equal  to  one  of the known locale cate-
              gories described in GAWK: Effective AWK  Program-
              ming.   You  must also supply a text domain.  Use
              TEXTDOMAIN if you want to use the current domain.

USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS
       Functions in AWK are defined as follows:

              function name(parameter list) { statements }

       Functions  are executed when they are called from within
       expressions  in  either  patterns  or  actions.   Actual
       parameters  supplied  in  the  function call are used to
       instantiate the formal parameters declared in the  func-
       tion.   Arrays  are passed by reference, other variables
       are passed by value.

       Since functions were not originally part of the AWK lan-
       guage,  the  provision  for  local  variables  is rather
       clumsy: They are declared as  extra  parameters  in  the
       parameter  list.   The  convention  is to separate local
       variables from real parameters by extra  spaces  in  the
       parameter list.  For example:

              function  f(p, q,     a, b)   # a and b are local
              {
                   ...
              }

              /abc/     { ... ; f(1, 2) ; ... }

       The  left  parenthesis in a function call is required to
       immediately follow the function name, without any inter-
       vening  white  space.  This avoids a syntactic ambiguity
       with the concatenation operator.  This restriction  does
       not apply to the built-in functions listed above.

       Functions  may  call  each  other  and may be recursive.
       Function parameters used as local variables are initial-
       ized  to  the null string and the number zero upon func-
       tion invocation.

       Use return expr to return a value from a function.   The
       return value is undefined if no value is provided, or if
       the function returns by "falling off" the end.

       If --lint has been provided, gawk warns about  calls  to
       undefined  functions  at  parse  time, instead of at run
       time.  Calling an undefined function at run  time  is  a
       fatal error.

       The word func may be used in place of function.

DYNAMICALLY LOADING NEW FUNCTIONS
       Beginning  with version 3.1 of gawk, you can dynamically
       add new built-in functions to the  running  gawk  inter-
       preter.   The  full details are beyond the scope of this
       manual page; see GAWK: Effective AWK Programming for the
       details.


       extension(object, function)
               Dynamically link the shared object file named by
               object, and invoke function in that  object,  to
               perform  initialization.   These  should both be
               provided as strings.  Returns the value returned
               by function.

       This function is provided and documented in GAWK: Effec-
       tive AWK Programming, but everything about this  feature
       is  likely  to change eventually.  We STRONGLY recommend
       that you do not use this feature for anything  that  you
       aren't willing to redo.

SIGNALS
       pgawk  accepts two signals.  SIGUSR1 causes it to dump a
       profile and function call stack  to  the  profile  file,
       which  is either awkprof.out, or whatever file was named
       with the --profile option.  It then  continues  to  run.
       SIGHUP  causes  pgawk  to  dump the profile and function
       call stack and then exit.

EXAMPLES
       Print and sort the login names of all users:

            BEGIN     { FS = ":" }
                 { print $1 | "sort" }

       Count lines in a file:

                 { nlines++ }
            END  { print nlines }

       Precede each line by its number in the file:

            { print FNR, $0 }

       Concatenate and line number (a variation on a theme):

            { print NR, $0 }
       Run an external command for particular lines of data:

            tail -f access_log |
            awk '/myhome.html/ { system("nmap " $1 ">> logdir/myhome.html") }'

INTERNATIONALIZATION
       String constants are sequences of characters enclosed in
       double quotes.  In non-English speaking environments, it
       is possible to  mark  strings  in  the  AWK  program  as
       requiring  translation  to  the native natural language.
       Such strings are marked in the AWK program with a  lead-
       ing underscore ("_").  For example,

              gawk 'BEGIN { print "hello, world" }'

       always prints hello, world.  But,

              gawk 'BEGIN { print _"hello, world" }'

       might print bonjour, monde in France.

       There  are  several steps involved in producing and run-
       ning a localizable AWK program.

       1.  Add a BEGIN action to assign a value to the  TEXTDO-
           MAIN variable to set the text domain to a name asso-
           ciated with your program.

           BEGIN { TEXTDOMAIN = "myprog" }

       This allows gawk to find the .mo  file  associated  with
       your program.  Without this step, gawk uses the messages
       text domain, which likely does not contain  translations
       for your program.

       2.  Mark  all  strings  that  should  be translated with
           leading underscores.

       3.  If necessary, use the dcgettext() and/or bindtextdo-
           main() functions in your program, as appropriate.

       4.  Run  gawk --gen-po -f myprog.awk > myprog.po to gen-
           erate a .po file for your program.

       5.  Provide  appropriate  translations,  and  build  and
           install the corresponding .mo files.

       The  internationalization features are described in full
       detail in GAWK: Effective AWK Programming.

POSIX COMPATIBILITY
       A primary goal for gawk is compatibility with the  POSIX
       standard,  as  well  as  with the latest version of UNIX
       awk.  To this end, gawk incorporates the following  user
       visible  features  which  are  not  described in the AWK
       book, but are part of the Bell Laboratories  version  of
       awk, and are in the POSIX standard.

       The book indicates that command line variable assignment
       happens when awk would otherwise open the argument as  a
       file,  which is after the BEGIN block is executed.  How-
       ever, in earlier implementations, when such  an  assign-
       ment  appeared  before  any  file  names, the assignment
       would happen before the BEGIN block was  run.   Applica-
       tions  came  to  depend on this "feature."  When awk was
       changed to match its documentation, the  -v  option  for
       assigning  variables  before program execution was added
       to accommodate applications that depended upon  the  old
       behavior.   (This  feature  was  agreed upon by both the
       Bell Laboratories and the GNU developers.)

       The -W option for implementation  specific  features  is
       from the POSIX standard.

       When  processing arguments, gawk uses the special option
       "--" to signal the end of arguments.   In  compatibility
       mode,  it  warns  about  but otherwise ignores undefined
       options.  In normal operation, such arguments are passed
       on to the AWK program for it to process.

       The  AWK  book  does  not  define  the  return  value of
       srand().  The POSIX standard has it return the  seed  it
       was  using,  to  allow  keeping  track  of random number
       sequences.  Therefore srand() in gawk also  returns  its
       current seed.

       Other  new  features are: The use of multiple -f options
       (from MKS awk); the ENVIRON array; the \a, and \v escape
       sequences (done originally in gawk and fed back into the
       Bell Laboratories version); the tolower() and  toupper()
       built-in functions (from the Bell Laboratories version);
       and the ANSI C conversion specifications in printf (done
       first in the Bell Laboratories version).

HISTORICAL FEATURES
       There are two features of historical AWK implementations
       that gawk supports.  First, it is possible to  call  the
       length()  built-in  function  not only with no argument,
       but even without parentheses!  Thus,

              a = length     # Holy Algol 60, Batman!

       is the same as either of

              a = length()
              a = length($0)

       This feature is marked  as  "deprecated"  in  the  POSIX
       standard,  and  gawk  issues  a warning about its use if
       --lint is specified on the command line.

       The other feature is the use of either the  continue  or
       the  break  statements outside the body of a while, for,
       or  do  loop.   Traditional  AWK  implementations   have
       treated  such usage as equivalent to the next statement.
       Gawk supports this usage if --traditional has been spec-
       ified.

GNU EXTENSIONS
       Gawk  has a number of extensions to POSIX awk.  They are
       described in this section.  All the extensions described
       here  can be disabled by invoking gawk with the --tradi-
       tional or --posix options.

       The following features of  gawk  are  not  available  in
       POSIX awk.

       · No path search is performed for files named via the -f
         option.  Therefore the AWKPATH environment variable is
         not special.

       · The \x escape sequence.  (Disabled with --posix.)

       · The fflush() function.  (Disabled with --posix.)

       · The  ability  to continue lines after ?  and :.  (Dis-
         abled with --posix.)

       · Octal and hexadecimal constants in AWK programs.

       · The ARGIND, BINMODE, ERRNO, LINT,  RT  and  TEXTDOMAIN
         variables are not special.

       · The  IGNORECASE  variable and its side-effects are not
         available.

       · The FIELDWIDTHS variable and fixed-width field  split-
         ting.

       · The PROCINFO array is not available.

       · The use of RS as a regular expression.

       · The  special  file names available for I/O redirection
         are not recognized.

       · The |& operator for creating co-processes.

       · The ability to split out individual  characters  using
         the  null  string as the value of FS, and as the third
         argument to split().

       · The optional second argument to the close()  function.

       · The optional third argument to the match() function.

       · The  ability  to use positional specifiers with printf
         and sprintf().

       · The ability to pass an array to length().

       · The use of delete array to delete the entire  contents
         of an array.

       · The  use of nextfile to abandon processing of the cur-
         rent input file.

       · The  and(),   asort(),   asorti(),   bindtextdomain(),
         compl(),    dcgettext(),    dcngettext(),    gensub(),
         lshift(), mktime(), or(), rshift(),  strftime(),  str-
         tonum(), systime() and xor() functions.

       · Localizable strings.

       · Adding  new  built-in  functions  dynamically with the
         extension() function.

       The AWK book does not define the  return  value  of  the
       close() function.  Gawk's close() returns the value from
       fclose(3), or pclose(3), when closing an output file  or
       pipe,  respectively.  It returns the process's exit sta-
       tus when closing an input pipe.  The return value is  -1
       if  the  named  file,  pipe or co-process was not opened
       with a redirection.

       When gawk is invoked with the --traditional  option,  if
       the  fs argument to the -F option is "t", then FS is set
       to the tab character.  Note that typing  gawk  -F\t  ...
       simply  causes  the shell to quote the "t," and does not
       pass "\t" to the -F option.  Since this is a rather ugly
       special  case,  it  is  not  the default behavior.  This
       behavior also does not occur if --posix has been  speci-
       fied.   To really get a tab character as the field sepa-
       rator, it is best to use single quotes: gawk -F'\t' ....

       If gawk is configured with the --enable-switch option to
       the configure command, then  it  accepts  an  additional
       control-flow statement:
              switch (expression) {
              case value|regex : statement
              ...
              [ default: statement ]
              }

       If  gawk  is  configured with the --disable-directories-
       fatal option, then it  will  silently  skip  directories
       named  on  the  command  line.  Otherwise, it will do so
       only if invoked with the --traditional option.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The AWKPATH environment variable can be used to  provide
       a  list  of  directories that gawk searches when looking
       for files named via the -f and --file options.

       If POSIXLY_CORRECT exists in the environment, then  gawk
       behaves  exactly as if --posix had been specified on the
       command line.  If --lint has been specified, gawk issues
       a warning message to this effect.

BUGS
       The  -F  option  is not necessary given the command line
       variable assignment feature; it remains only  for  back-
       wards compatibility.

       Syntactically  invalid single character programs tend to
       overflow the parse stack, generating a rather  unhelpful
       message.   Such  programs  are surprisingly difficult to
       diagnose in the completely general case, and the  effort
       to do so really is not worth it.

AUTHORS
       The original version of UNIX awk was designed and imple-
       mented  by  Alfred  Aho,  Peter  Weinberger,  and  Brian
       Kernighan of Bell Laboratories.  Brian Kernighan contin-
       ues to maintain and enhance it.

       Paul Rubin and Jay Fenlason, of the Free Software  Foun-
       dation,  wrote  gawk, to be compatible with the original
       version of awk  distributed  in  Seventh  Edition  UNIX.
       John  Woods  contributed  a  number of bug fixes.  David
       Trueman, with contributions from  Arnold  Robbins,  made
       gawk  compatible  with  the  new  version  of  UNIX awk.
       Arnold Robbins is the current maintainer.

       The initial DOS port was done by Conrad Kwok  and  Scott
       Garfinkle.   Scott Deifik is the current DOS maintainer.
       Pat Rankin did the port to VMS,  and  Michal  Jaegermann
       did the port to the Atari ST.  The port to OS/2 was done
       by Kai Uwe Rommel, with contributions and help from Dar-
       rel  Hankerson.  Juan M. Guerrero now maintains the OS/2
       port.  Fred Fish supplied support  for  the  Amiga,  and
       Martin  Brown  provided  the  BeOS port.  Stephen Davies
       provided the original Tandem port, and  Matthew  Woehlke
       provided changes for Tandem's POSIX-compliant systems.

VERSION INFORMATION
       This man page documents gawk, version 3.1.6.

BUG REPORTS
       If  you  find a bug in gawk, please send electronic mail
       to bug-gawk@gnu.org.  Please include your operating sys-
       tem  and  its  revision,  the version of gawk (from gawk
       --version), what C compiler you used to compile it,  and
       a  test  program  and data that are as small as possible
       for reproducing the problem.

       Before sending a bug report,  please  do  the  following
       things.   First, verify that you have the latest version
       of gawk.  Many bugs (usually subtle ones) are  fixed  at
       each  release,  and if yours is out of date, the problem
       may already have been solved.   Second,  please  see  if
       setting  the  environment  variable  LC_ALL  to LC_ALL=C
       causes things to behave as you expect.  If  so,  it's  a
       locale  issue,  and  may  or  may  not  really be a bug.
       Finally, please read this man  page  and  the  reference
       manual carefully to be sure that what you think is a bug
       really is, instead of just a quirk in the language.

       Whatever  you  do,  do  NOT  post  a   bug   report   in
       comp.lang.awk.   While  the gawk developers occasionally
       read this newsgroup, posting bug  reports  there  is  an
       unreliable  way to report bugs.  Instead, please use the
       electronic mail addresses given above.

       If you're using a GNU/Linux system or BSD-based  system,
       you  may  wish  to  submit a bug report to the vendor of
       your distribution.  That's fine, but please send a  copy
       to  the official email address as well, since there's no
       guarantee that the bug will be  forwarded  to  the  gawk
       maintainer.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       Brian  Kernighan  of Bell Laboratories provided valuable
       assistance during testing and debugging.  We thank  him.
